## Cleaning Database
The selected database was cleaned using pandas. 
Several columns were deleted as there were of no use for our project's purpose. The airlines' names were added in place of those airlines' codes. Columns were rearranged. 

All the CSV files were uploaded to a S3 bucket:

Cleaning process was done using Jupyter Notebook, file attached in this branch.
