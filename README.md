# Final_Project

## Selected Topic
	
  Flight Delay Prediction

## Reason why they selected their topic
	
  We choose this topic because we want to know what attributes are the ones that are the most important to generate a delay in a certain flight. And in that way we will create a web page for users that will fill attributes and give them a forecast with machine learning if the flight will be “on time” o “Delay”

## Description of their source of data
	
  The data will contain info about the flight like: Day of the Week, Day of the Month, Month, Airline Carrier Code, Operating Airline, Origin Airport, Destination Airport, Departure Time, ArrDelay.

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
	
  The certainty if the flight they will take, will be “On Time” or “Delay”.
