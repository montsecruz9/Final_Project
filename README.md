# Final_Project

## Selected Topic
	
  Flight Delay Prediction

## Reason why they selected their topic
	
  We choose this topic because we want to know what attributes are the ones that are the most important to generate a delay in a certain flight. And in that way we will create a web page for users that will fill attributes and give them a forecast with machine learning if the flight will be “on time” o “Delay”

## Description of their source of data
	
  The data will contain info about the flight like: Day of the Week, Day of the Month, Airline Carrier Code, Operating Airline, Origin Airport, Destination Airport, Departure Time, ArrDelay.

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
	
  The certainty if the flight they will take, will be “On Time” or “Delay”.

## Communication protocols:

Our team will be communicating through Slack and working on the same repositoy on github. Every team member also has their own branch in order to make changes without affecting the main branch. Before every pull request another team member should let the others know before committing the pull to the main branch. In case someone needs help they should let the team know through Slack and everyone should help regardless of their roll. It responsability of each individual to let the team know if they need help, won't anttend class or has an issue of any type.
