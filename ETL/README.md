#Flights Delay
We obtain information from flights around United States in 2021 and 2022. The raw data was very huge and we had to clean it and get rid of a lot of columns that werenÂ´t useful.
At the end, we ended up with more than 10 million rows of data and it processed with SQL RDS in order to be ready for Machine Learning and analysis. 

Some of the variables we used were:
-Day of Week
-Day of Month
-Delay or On time
-Airline
